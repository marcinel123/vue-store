# vue-store

Hello there :)

Welcome to my first personal Vue-Store. It has been made using Vue.js (ver. 3, composition api). Also I used Json server for keeping data from (https://fakestoreapi.com/).

Please have a look and enjoy buing a few things :)

P.S I checked several times locally and everything worked fine but Netlify can be really unpredictable :)
